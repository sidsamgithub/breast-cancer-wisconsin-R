# breast-cancer-wisconsin-R

#### Responsive WebApp made in Shiny framework in R to display decision tree and make predictions 

This is a data analysis project made in R to implement an RShiny webapp. I used Shiny to display and control the splitting parameter in decision tree algorithm.
I also created a GUI which accepts input values according to the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset  https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/breast+cancer+wisconsin+(original) and makes a prediction using Decision Tree. The project also compares other tree algorithms like RandomForest and Conditional Inference Tree.
